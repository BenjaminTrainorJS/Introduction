Hello, I am Benjamin Trainor.

I am a 32 year-old native of New Zealand (as of Feb 2020). With my wife, we are currently living in Adelaide, Australia.

Ever since 2012, when I was living with my ccousin (who was then a PHP developer) I have been intrigued with programming and web development. Since then I have dabbled here, and there with learning Web Development technologies, including a bit of Functional Programming with Haskell when we were up near Brisbane. But with work and sometimes sport commitments I just never had the 100% commitment to jump all in.

It is Wednesday the 26th of February and as of this moment I am enrolled to attend the 15 week 'Enspiral Dev Academy': Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp from April through to July 2020. See: https://devacademy.co.nz/

I am also working my way through both 'The Odin Project', see: https://www.theodinproject.com, and https://www.freecodecamp.org

I am partial towards Functinal Programming and would be insterested in due time to learn Elixir, and Haskell.

For now I am focussing on the JavaScript stack, including: React, Express, Node, Vanilla, and Vue.

This is an introduction to myself for those who are interested in joining me on future potential open-source projects.
